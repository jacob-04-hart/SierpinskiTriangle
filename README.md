# Sierpinski's Triangle
## Made with <3 and GLFW

A simple OpenGL project using GLFW to render the classic Sierpinski Triangle fractal.

## About

This is my first OpenGL project. While simple, it helped me learn the basics of OpenGL and graphics programming.  
I plan to add more features, such as shaders and transformations. Working on this project has enforced my interest in fractals, and I hope to create more cool-ass 2D and 3D fractal visualizations with OpenGL in the future.

## Requirements

- OpenGL (development libraries)
- GLFW
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- CMake or Make (depending on your build system)

## How to Run

1. Build the project (see your build instructions or Makefile).
2. Run the executable:
   ```sh
   ./SierpinskiTriangle
   ```
